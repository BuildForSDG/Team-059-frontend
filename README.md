## About

This is a solution that will help substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers in your community. Included is a plan to integrate or collaborate with international cooperations for teachers to be trained in developing countries.  

This is a Laravel and React.Js project. The setup contains

-  Composer: For adding third party dependencies

-  phpunit: For runnung tests

-  php-cs-fixer: For formatting code to match php coding standard

## Why

The number of registered and qualified teachers globally is low and it is drastically reducing leaving us with teachers that are not qualified or under qualified in the educational system. Some qualified teachers has gone for some other profession rather than teaching. 
The quality and quantity of teachers determines the quality and quantity of impact made on the young generation which in turn affects the development of all sectors globally.

## Usage

## Setup

Run `composer install` , `composer dump-autoload` , `cp .env.example .env` , `php artisan key:generate` and `npm install` to get started.

## Contributing
If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
